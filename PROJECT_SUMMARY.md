# AI Travel Agent - Project Summary

## 🎯 What We Built

This is a **proof-of-concept AI travel agent** that demonstrates **agentic AI capabilities** using LangChain and Streamlit. The application showcases how AI agents can coordinate multiple tools to provide comprehensive travel planning assistance.

## 🤖 Agentic AI Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Multi-Tool Coordination**
- The agent automatically selects and uses the appropriate tools based on user requests
- Tools include: flight search, hotel search, weather forecast, and travel recommendations
- Seamless coordination between different data sources and APIs

### 2. **Natural Language Understanding**
- Users can ask questions in natural language
- The agent understands context and intent
- Handles complex, multi-part requests (e.g., "Plan a romantic trip to Paris with flights and hotels")

### 3. **Contextual Memory**
- Maintains conversation history
- Remembers previous interactions within a session
- Provides coherent, contextual responses

### 4. **Intelligent Tool Selection**
- Automatically determines which tools to use
- Combines multiple tools when needed
- Handles edge cases and errors gracefully

### Agent Flow
1. **User Input** → Natural language query
2. **Intent Recognition** → Agent determines what the user wants
3. **Tool Selection** → Agent chooses appropriate tools
4. **Tool Execution** → Tools fetch/process data
5. **Response Generation** → Agent synthesizes information
6. **User Output** → Formatted, helpful response
