## ü§ñ Agentic AI Implementation

This project demonstrates the power of **Agentic AI** in real-world applications through a sophisticated travel planning system. The AI agent operates as an autonomous travel consultant that can:

- **Multi-Tool Orchestration**: Seamlessly coordinates between flight search, hotel booking, weather forecasting, and travel recommendations
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Automatically selects the best API endpoints, handles errors gracefully, and provides fallback options
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains conversation context across multiple user interactions and remembers preferences
- **Proactive Problem Solving**: Identifies potential issues (like past dates, API failures) and suggests alternatives
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands complex travel requests in natural language and breaks them down into actionable tasks
- **Complete Booking Workflows**: Handles entire booking processes from search to confirmation
- **Smart Response Formatting**: Automatically formats responses for optimal readability and user experience

**What This Project Proves:**
This travel planner showcases how agentic AI can transform complex, multi-step processes into seamless user experiences. It proves that AI agents can handle real-world scenarios involving multiple external APIs, error handling, user preferences, and complete booking workflows while maintaining conversational flow. The system demonstrates that agentic AI is not just about individual tools, but about creating intelligent workflows that adapt to user needs, handle failures gracefully, and provide comprehensive solutions. This approach can be applied to any domain requiring coordination between multiple services, making it a powerful paradigm for building next-generation AI applications.

```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New APIs

To add a new API integration, modify the `_create_tools()` method in `travel_agent.py`:

```python
@tool
def your_new_api_tool(param1: str, param2: int) -> str:
    """Description of what your tool does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter 1
        param2: Description of parameter 2
    
    Returns:
        String with API results
    """
    # Your API implementation here
    return "API results"
```

### Modifying Fallback Data

City-specific fallback data can be customized in the hotel search function:

```python
# Add new city-specific hotels
elif 'your_city' in city_lower:
    hotels = [
        {"name": "Hotel Name", "rating": 4.5, "location": "Area", "price": 200, "amenities": ["WiFi", "Pool"]}
    ]
```

### Adding New Airlines

To add new airline codes, update the `airline_names` dictionary in the flight search function:

```python
airline_names = {
    # Existing airlines...
    'NEW': 'New Airline Name',
    'ABC': 'Another Airline Company'
}
```
